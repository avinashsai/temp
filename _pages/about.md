I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill advised by Prof. [Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com/). My area of interests include Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Multi-modal learning (NLP + CV + Robotics). I also work with Prof. [Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com/) on multi-modal video retrieval.

I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute India-Bangalore. I worked on Bixby, the personal assistant of Samsung in electronic devices. My job was to design Natural Language Understanding Models for identifying issues faced by users while using Bixby.
